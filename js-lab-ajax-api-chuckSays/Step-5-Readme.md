Ok, so you want to level up!

### Make a filter

So, the API has an explicit category.  And some of the quotes can be a bit adult.  So make a FAMILY friendly version by making a filter.  How?  Well, a couple of options.

1. Use the `filter()` array method to remove the explicit category and/or adult words.
2. Use Regex to "search" the quote string.
3. Use conditionals with a list of adult words.
4. OTHER?

Remember, we are here to SOLVE PROBLEMS.  Give it a go!

### Style it

Make it your own!  Style the app with CSS.  Add images (maybe a different image for each quote?).  I would make them Chuck Norris images, but whatever. The sky is the limit.

### Deploy it!

Use GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Render to deploy your Chuck Says app!  All of these are easy to use and each has good docs on how to do it. Just connect your GitHub REPO!!
